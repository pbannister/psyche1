#
# skeleton-diff.sh: report how a derived project's shared files differ from
# this skeleton.
#
# A project derived from the skeleton keeps its own copy of the shared rule
# files, and those copies drift as the skeleton evolves. Run this from the
# skeleton against a project:
#
#     sh scripts/skeleton-diff.sh ~/work/<project>
#
# Files fall into three groups:
#
#   rules     Shared rule files; they must match this skeleton byte for byte.
#             A difference is drift and the script exits nonzero.
#   append    Shared documents a project extends with its own content (its
#             glossary terms, its document index, its episode index, the
#             project-pages summary). The skeleton's text must still be present
#             unchanged; additions are expected. Removing or rewording the
#             shared text is drift.
#   template  Reference scripts and the template, which a project adapts
#             (its own page title, extra assets). Differences are reported as
#             informational and do not fail.
#
# The append rule is the sanctioned customization pattern: append a project
# section, never fork the shared text. See prompts/03-conventions.md 5.
