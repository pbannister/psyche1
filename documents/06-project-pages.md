# Project Pages (publishing conventions)

This document summarizes the project-pages publishing conventions that a
project started from this skeleton adopts. The canonical, authoritative
description lives in the homelab project:
`documents/09-project-pages-conventions.md`. This document is the skeleton's
summary of it and points back to the canonical source.

## Why pages exist

A project's published pages are its **read interface**: status, live state,
work plan (TODO), rules (prompts), and knowledge (documents). A human or LLM
can understand the project — and decide how to work with it — without
escaping the project's sandbox.

## The standard page set

A project publishes a directory tree served at `/projects/<id>/`, with a
consistent relative nav. Every page is required:

| Page | Content |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | **Status**: what the project is, its current status, how it works. |
| `dashboard.html` | **Dashboard**: live state (point-in-time values from the owning host). |
| `todo.html` | **Condensed TODO**: open work items. |
| `prompts.html` | **Prompts index**: the entire `prompts/` tree, grouped by directory, linking to full-text pages. |
| `documents.html` | **Documents index**: every file in `documents/`, linking to full-text pages. |
| `records.html` | **Records index**: every file in `records/`, linking to full-text pages. |

Rules:

- The generated pages (`todo.html`, `prompts.html`, `documents.html`,
  `records.html`) are **generated at build time** from the project's own
  files — never hand-maintained. The generator is `scripts/site-condense.sh`,
  wired into `make site` alongside `scripts/site-build.sh`.
- **Every `.md` file under `prompts/` (the entire tree), `documents/`, and
  `records/` is published as its own full-text page** (e.g.
  `prompts-common-02-universal-rules.html`), linked from the index pages.
  Markdown is rendered with pandoc when available (minimal fallback
  otherwise).
- `todo.html` stays condensed: open items with their continuation text,
  completed items summarized as a count.
- **Relative links only**, so the pages work at any depth under
  `/projects/<id>/`.
- **A page below the project root climbs out with `../`** — one level per
  directory. Apply the prefix to the nav block only, never to a page's own
  relative links; a nav bug at depth is invisible at the root, so test both
  shapes.
- **Replace the skeleton's placeholder `index.txt`/`dashboard.txt`** before
  registering: a published placeholder describes a project that does not
  exist.
- **Generate the dashboard from live state** (the state file, the tool's own
  output, or the build manifest) rather than maintaining live values by hand.
- A served asset that a page loads (script, style, image, model) carries a
  content version in its URL, including transitive imports, so a long-cached
  asset is re-requested when its bytes change.
- **The homelab owns the one navigation bar.** The template marks where it
  belongs with `<!-- HOMELAB-NAV -->` and must not contain a `<nav>` of its
  own; the homelab injects the bar (graphic, breadcrumb, and the project's
  page links) at publish time, and removes any project-authored `<nav>`.
  Projects never hardcode the labs site URL.
- **The page set is declared** in `site.in/pages.nav` (optional), an ordered
  `href|Label` list that must contain the standard set; `make site` writes
  `site.out/pages.txt` for the homelab (the standard set when there is no
  file). Extra pages are listed there and appear in the one nav.
- Pages are self-contained (their own `<style>`); the reference template is
  `site.in/template.html`.
- The `<title>` of every page must be a real title, never the bare file name.
- Recommended: a footer line linking back to `../` and naming the project.
- Generated output (`site.out/`) is gitignored; only `site.in/` is authored.

## Registration and publishing (homelab model)

- The project **registers once** in the homelab project's
  `sources/projects.yaml` (fields: `id`, `title`, `summary`, `status`,
  `visibility`, `self_published: true`, `pages_source`).
- **Activity vs phase** (owner 2026-08-26): the registry `status`
  (active/planned/deferred/complete) is the human-declared **activity**,
  in the single common homelab. The project's **phase** belongs to this
  project: declare it in `PHASES.md` (`Current: phase N — state`), change
  it only when committing the project, and let `scripts/site-condense.sh`
  emit `site.out/phase.txt` so the homelab can show "active · phase N
  started" on the projects page.
- `pages_source` tells the homelab how to read the project's generated tree:
  a path (`site.out/`, local or SSHFS) or an ssh command that streams the
  tree.
- **The homelab project is the only publisher.** It fetches every registered
  `pages_source`, runs the leak gate, and publishes with its own deploy.
  Projects do **not** push to the web server themselves — a project's
  `make deploy` is retired and only reminds you of this.
- Live-state freshness: the project refreshes its own state (`make state`,
  run on the owning host for hardware/network values) before the homelab
  publishes.
- **Live state is placeholders plus a fetched state file.** A page carries
  `__UPPERCASE_KEY__` placeholders; `scripts/site-state-fetch.sh` writes
  `dataflow.out/site-state.txt` as `KEY=value` lines (overridable with
  `SITE_STATE_FILE`), and `scripts/site-build.sh` substitutes the values.
  A placeholder with no value renders as `unavailable`, so the pages build
  on a host that never ran the state fetch. Sanitize values at capture: the
  publishing gate refuses absolute home paths, and the values land in HTML.

## Sanitization (non-negotiable)

Published pages must contain no MAC addresses, private LAN IPs, usernames,
home paths, or private-key material. The exact gate patterns live in the
homelab (`scripts/labs-deploy.sh`, `tests/03-labs-site.sh`,
`tests/06-project-pages.sh`); the homelab re-runs the gate at publish time.

The project runs its own gate first: `scripts/leak-gate.sh` over `site.out/`,
reading the patterns from `scripts/sensitive-patterns.sh` — their single
source. Do not inline the patterns in another script or test; a duplicated
pattern has already drifted once. A record or document that describes the
gate must not quote the refused patterns verbatim (that version refuses
itself). Fix a false positive by tightening the pattern, not by suppressing
the check: match private addresses only as dotted quads, so a numbered
heading such as `## 10. Human Override` still passes.

## Conformance checklist

1. Read the canonical conventions doc in the homelab.
2. Generate the standard page set per the rules above (the skeleton's
   `site.in/` + `scripts/site-build.sh` + `scripts/site-condense.sh` +
   `make site` produce it).
3. Register once in the homelab `sources/projects.yaml` with a readable
   `pages_source`.
4. Confirm the leak gate passes over the generated output.
5. After a homelab deploy, verify
   `curl https://labs.bannister.us/projects/<id>/` returns 200 and the
   content is sanitized.

## Live example

- `amd-mi25-fan-service` (SSHFS at `~/remote/beast.lan/work/...`) and
  `model-elevation-earth` (`~/work/01-model-elevation-earth/`)
  are live at `labs.bannister.us/projects/<id>/` using exactly this pattern.

## How this project publishes

- Psyche1 builds the standard page set with `make site`; the status page
  (`site.in/index.txt`) and the dashboard (`site.in/dashboard.txt`) describe
  Psyche1, not the skeleton.
- `make state` captures the host, branch, commit, and Python version for the
  dashboard; a value with no state entry renders as `unavailable`.
- `make check` runs `scripts/leak-gate.sh` over `site.out/` before publishing.
- Registration in the homelab `sources/projects.yaml` (`pages_source`) is
  pending; until then the pages are built locally only.
