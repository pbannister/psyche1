# addresses, home paths, and key material, and that it does NOT refuse
# ordinary content that merely resembles a pattern (a public address, or a
# numbered heading like "## 10. Human Override").
#
# It also guards the single source: the pattern is defined in
# scripts/sensitive-patterns.sh and inlined nowhere else in scripts/.
